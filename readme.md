#CEX data

This project is related to the crypto-currency exchange cex.io, making use of their WebSocket API which is still in beta

The python file here is a way to create a data stream that resembles the files in /data. It is not intended to be installed as a standalone app, it is an example of how to construct such a data stream.

This was written and has been deployed on a raspberry pi with the intention to monitor the crypto-currency markets on cex.io 24/7
